Let's see some examples. First, the tree:
```
(A:0.1,(B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)100:0.05)100:0.1)90:0.43;
```

----
**example 1**, the default barplot:
```
!groups	group 1,group 2,group 3
!colors	#028482,#7ABA7A,#B76EB8
!title	barplot with data shown
!fan
!itemHeightPCT	80

### June~Aug, 2017
* added HTML mode;
  * the documentation is to be written.

### July 17, 2017
* bug fixes as always
  * fixed an issue that leaf label background overlaps with group labels of style 1
  * fixed an issue that the background box is smaller than the leaf label; also improved cross-browser compatibility on this issue

### July 11, 2017
* our documentation has been moved to GitHub!!!

Long-time users may still remember that Evolview documentation was originally hosted at Google Code, then was moved to MicroSoft CodePlex. This may never happen but let us hope that we do NOT have to move again!!!

### Jan 19, 2017
* use '!colorRecycle' modifier to stop recycling colors in "Color shapes and strips" plot.

For example by default colors will be recycled:

The tree:

```
(chicken,((mouse,rat),(chimp,human)));
```

----

```
##color strips
!type	strip,rect,circle,star,check,triangle
!showlegends	1
!defaultstrokewidth	2
!plotwidth	200
!colorRecycle	1

## let the data begin
mouse	pink,red,green,blue:brighter
chicken	yellow,purple,white:darkred,lightgreen:darker

## -- two objects will be plotted instead of six --
rat	lightblue,white:lightblue
chimp	grey,darkgreen:brighter,grey:darker,pink:darker
human	orange,red,white:gold,lightblue
```

![](/whatisnew/images/WhatsNew_colorrecycle2.png)

----
However, set  '!recycleColor' or '!colorRecycle' to 0 will stop cycling the colors:

```
##color strips
!type	strip,rect,circle,star,check,triangle
!showlegends	1
!defaultstrokewidth	2
!plotwidth	200

## -- recycle color, default is true --
## -- !type determines that maximally six objects will be displayed
## -- normally user-supplied colors will be recycled; for example,
## -- however, when !recycleColor is set to 0, the colors will not be recycled
!colorRecycle	0

## let the data begin
mouse	pink,red,green,blue:brighter
chicken	yellow,purple,white:darkred,lightgreen:darker

## -- two objects will be plotted instead of six --
rat	lightblue,white:lightblue
chimp	grey,darkgreen:brighter,grey:darker,pink:darker
human	orange,red,white:gold,lightblue
```

### Dec 29, 2016
* bug fixes
	* fixed a bug that the header disappeared in Mac Safari

### Nov 2, 2016
* bug fixes
	* fixed a bug that exporting to PDF fails on some circular group labels

### Aug 25, 2016
* bug fixes
	* fixed a bug that the exporting to png/jpeg/tiff functionality fails from time to time

### May 25, 2016
* bug fixes as always
* added support for two additional tree visualisation styles that can be used in combination with phylograms and cladograms. See [here](TreeStyles) for more information.

Here is an example:
1. the original tree:

![](images/WhatsNew_tree_vis_styles_02.png)

----

2. in combination with style 1:

![](images/WhatsNew_tree_vis_styles_03.png)

----

3. in combination with style 2:

![](images/WhatsNew_tree_vis_styles_04.png)

To turn on/off the new visualisation styles, use the corresponding icons on the Toolbar (as shown below):

![](images/WhatsNew_tree_vis_styles_01.png)

### May 22, 2016;
* bug fixes

### May 20, 2016
* bug fixes as always
* added support for a new bootstrap value style

here is the tree:

```
(A:0.1,(B:0.2,(C:0.3,(D:0.4,E:0.5)40:0.6)80:0.05)100:0.1)90:0.43;
```

the dataset:

```
## place=4
!bootstrapValueStyle	show=1,style=numeric,place=4,color=darkred
```

and the visualisation results:

![](images/WhatsNew_bootstrapvalues_place4.png)

### May 19, 2016
* added support for [multiple sets of bootstrap values](/datasets/11_bootstrap/DatasetBootstrapValueStyle.md); here is an example:

![](images/WhatsNew_multibootstraps_01.png)

See [here](/datasets/11_bootstrap/DatasetBootstrapValueStyle.md) for more information and examples.

### May 18, 2016
* added a new annotation type: [TimeLine](/datasets/14_timeline/DatasetTimeLine.md); here is an example:

![](images/WhatsNew_timeline_timeline.png)

See [here](/datasets/14_timeline/DatasetTimeLine.md) for more information and examples.

### Mar 1, 2016
* bug fixes as always ...
* allow user to copy datasets from one tree to others

![](images/WhatsNew_copyDatasets2OtherTrees.png)

![](images/WhatsNew_copyDatasets2OtherTrees2.png)

### Feb 19, 2016
* updated user interface for tree sharing

### Feb 3, 2016
* bug fixes
	* fixed a bug that the charts are not updated after the leaf labels are switched on/off

### Jan 29, 2016
* now Evolview is equipped with a "CodeMirror"-powered text-editor that features:
	* line numbers
	* current row highlight
	* keywords highlight

See the screenshot below:

![](images/WhatsNew_the_text_editor.png)

### Jan 28, 2016
* use scientific numbers as branch lengths

Float numbers less than 0.0001 (1e-4; non-inclusive) will be displayed as scientific numbers. For example, the tree:

```
(A:0.0001,(B:0.00002,(C:0.000003,D:0.000004)100:0.05)100:0.1)90:0.43;
```

will be visualised as:

![](images/WhatsNew_tiny_branch_length01.png)

In addition, branch lengths can be directly written as scientific numbers. For example, the following tree will be correctly parsed and visualised:

```
(A:1e-2,(B:0.00002,(C:0.000003,D:1.45e-5)100:0.05)100:0.1)90:0.43;
```

![](images/WhatsNew_tiny_branch_length02.png)

### Jan 26, 2016
* bug fixes
	* fixed an issue caused by Google Chrome ver 48+
	* datasets for 'Bootstrap value style' can only be uploaded for trees with bootstrap values (of course)
	* fixed an issue that causes blank page in certain browsers after the deployment of a new version

### Jan 20, 2016
* added support for collapsing at internal nodes; with this annotation type, users can :
	* collapse at internal nodes
	* show a small triangle at the collapsed nodes that is proportional to the number of leaves that the collapsed node contains

Here is an example:

![](images/WhatsNew_collapse_internal_nodes.png)

See [here](/datasets/13_collapse_at_internal_nodes/DatasetCollapseInternalNodes.md) for more information and examples.

### Jan 14, 2016
* now Evolview can correctly parse and display parentheses in leaf node names. As long as they come in pairs, parentheses can be put at anywhere (start, end, middle) of the leaf name; multiple and nested parentheses in a single leaf name are also supported.

For example, the tree below:

```
( ( (
(A)(NC_1)B(C):0.4,
((B)B_(NC_2)):0.3)90:0.2,
(
C_(NC_3):0.1,
(D_(NC_4)):0.001)75:0.2 )90:0.3,
E_(NC_5)_E:0.44 )100:0.3;
```

will be visualised as:

![](images/WhatsNew_leaf_names_with_parentheses.png)


### Dec 6, 2015
* added a new type anntation dataset: Column plots, it allow users to visualise complex summary information of species in a phylogenetic tree, here is an example:

![](images/WhatsNew_example_07.png)

See [here](/datasets/12_column_plot/DatasetColumnPlots.md) for more information.

### Dec 5, 2015
* added support for the use of 'darker' or 'brighter' as stroke colors, see the section ['Stroke color and width'](/datasets/01_stroke_color_and_width/DatasetStroke.md) and related sections in the annotation datasets.

for example:
	* green:darker == use darker green as stroke color; the stroke color is usually 20% darker than the specified color
	* purple:ligher or purple:brighter == use lighter purple as stroke color; the stroke color will be 20% brighter than the specific color

Here are some examples:

![](images/WhatsNew_barplot_use_darker_lighter_as_strokecolor.png)

![](images/WhatsNew_columnplots_popup_annotated.png)

### Dec 4, 2015
* added a new type of annotation dataset: bootstrap value styles, it allows users to change the
	* visiblity
	* color
	* size
	* style / shape and
	* position of the bootstrap scores according to their
	* values, e.g. 40, or
	* value ranges, e.g. 10~60

see [here](/datasets/11_bootstrap/DatasetBootstrapValueStyle.md) for detail.

Here are some examples:

![](images/WhatsNew_bootstrapValueStyles.png)

![](images/WhatsNew_bootstrapvalues_circles_with_different_colors.png)

![](images/WhatsNew_bootstrapvalues_place2.png)

![](images/WhatsNew_dotplots_columnLabelStyle.png)

### Nov 30, 2015
